This is the supporting documentation for the Course Project: Shiny Application.

This Shiny App is meant for people interested in becoming social media influencers. It estimates the revenue from Ads and level of influence based on number of followers.

Instructions:

(1) Type your name in "Your Name:" box.
(2) Indicate how many followers your channel has on the slider.

The results include 3 tabs.

The 1st tab displays a plot with the estimated revenue from Ads based on a fictional dataset.
The 2nd tab interprets the revenue results in an easy-to-understand manner.
The 3rd tab suggests your level of influence on the community based on the number of followers.

Thank you.
